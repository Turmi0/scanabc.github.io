# Web snapshots

Each month, we celebrate the achievements of Scandinavian ABC
startups by picking a new background picture to the
[scanabc.com](http://www.scanabc.com) webpage. We give the inside
scoop of each picture below.

New year arrived and the Finns got a glimpse of the sunlight.

At the end of the year we went back to the roots to finalize
SensurFu plans. Picture is from Pudasjärvi [(map)](https://goo.gl/maps/7EAAAYZgcTp)
, the home town for many of us. And a good place for a retreat.

Pudasjärvi is in the vicinity of Oulu. In the 90s, it got proper
Internet-access among the first small municipalities in Finland.
Early exposure to the Internet gave a good base for youngsters
to learn the perks of networking and security. Growing up, many
moved to bigger cities and made cyber defense their career.
Many of them work in Scandinavian ABC ecosystem.

## 2016-12 - All of This Has Happened Before

```All of this has happened before - and will happen again.```

At the end of 2013 we released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWg3BXjtJAo
). The video celebrated the successes of different
early adopters of the Finnish model for civilian cyber
defense.

At the end of 2016, the approaches talked in the video are now
mainstream. Our eyes are set to things undone.
In the spirit of Battlestar Galactica (2004) we
used a screenshot of the video as a background: *All of this has
happened before and will happen again.* [(YouTube clip)](https://youtu.be/6bOy3RNyWME)
